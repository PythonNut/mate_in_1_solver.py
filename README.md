# Python Mate in 1 Solver

A algorithms written in python to solve [this question on chess.SE](https://chess.stackexchange.com/questions/14610/what-is-the-highest-number-of-different-mates-in-1-you-can-have-in-one-legal-p).

Two algorithms have been implemented:
  * Genetic Algorithm
  * Simulated Annealing

In this case, the Simulated Annealing program produced significantly better results than the Genetic Algorithm, but took weeks to run.

Depends on:
  * [`python-chess`](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/python-chess)
  * `matplotlib`
  * `numpy`
